**The Popularity of Monopoly Go**  
Monopoly Go has taken the world by storm with its innovative take on the classic board game. With its mobile app version and new ways to win, it has garnered millions of users globally. However, recent developments surrounding "Free Mitts" have sparked a series of legal debates. 

**What Are Free Mitts in Monopoly Go?**  
"Free Mitts" are promotional rewards given to players of Monopoly Go, offering in-game advantages. These rewards have raised questions on fairness, and many players have alleged that the system behind them is manipulative.

**The Legal Grounds for the Class Action**

**Deceptive Advertising Practices**  
A key aspect of the lawsuit involves claims of deceptive advertising. The developers of Monopoly Go allegedly misrepresented the value of the "Free Mitts" and failed to provide full transparency regarding how players could earn and use them.

**Unfair Terms and Conditions**  
Many plaintiffs have argued that the terms and conditions surrounding the free rewards were unfair, with hidden clauses that made it difficult for users to fully benefit from the promotion. The legal team representing the class action claims that these terms were not clearly communicated.

**Violation of Consumer Protection Laws**  
The lawsuit also alleges that the practices violated state and federal consumer protection laws, as they misled consumers into making financial decisions that they otherwise would not have made.

For players who participated in the Monopoly Go Free Mitts promotion, the impact has been twofold. First, many players have found that the rewards were difficult to redeem, and second, they argue that the promotional system caused them to spend more money than anticipated, often without receiving the advertised benefits.

**What Happens if the Class Action Succeeds?**  
If the lawsuit is successful, players may be entitled to compensation, and the game's developers may be required to change their promotional practices. This could lead to a larger shift in how mobile games handle in-game purchases and rewards.

**Updates on the Class Action Lawsuit**  
As of the latest updates, the class action lawsuit is in the discovery phase, where both parties are gathering evidence. The developers have denied any wrongdoing, claiming that all promotions were transparent and within legal bounds. Players, however, continue to push for accountability.
